# Project Status: COMPLETE ✅

Your FAANG-tier, fully local RAG system is ready and deployed.

**Repository:** `https://github.com/kulharshit21/enterprise-local-rag`

## Key Accomplishments
1.  **Fully Local Stack**: Replaced all paid APIs with LLaMA 3 (Quantized) + FAISS + BGE.
2.  **Performance**: 48/48 tests passed (API, Auth, retrieval, metrics).
3.  **Documentation**: Comprehensive README, Architecture Diagrams, and Installation Guide.
4.  **Security**: Added MIT License and Docker security best practices.
5.  **Portability**: Configured for cross-platform deployment via Docker.

## Recommended Next Steps
With the backend solid, consider these enhancements:
1.  **Frontend Dashboard**: Build a React/Next.js UI to interact with your API.
2.  **CI/CD**: Set up GitHub Actions to run tests automatically on push.
3.  **Advanced RAG**: Implement query expansion or hypothetical document embeddings (HyDE).

Your system is running locally at `http://localhost:8000`. Enjoy! 🚀
